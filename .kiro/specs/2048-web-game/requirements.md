# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The 2048 Web Game is a browser-based implementation of the popular sliding puzzle game where players combine numbered tiles to reach the 2048 tile. The game features a 4x4 grid where players use arrow keys to slide tiles, merging identical numbers to create higher values. The game tracks scoring and ends when no more moves are possible, displaying the final score to the player.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control tile movement using arrow keys, so that I can play the game intuitively with keyboard input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses the up arrow key THEN the system SHALL move all tiles upward and merge identical adjacent tiles
2. WHEN the player presses the down arrow key THEN the system SHALL move all tiles downward and merge identical adjacent tiles  
3. WHEN the player presses the left arrow key THEN the system SHALL move all tiles leftward and merge identical adjacent tiles
4. WHEN the player presses the right arrow key THEN the system SHALL move all tiles rightward and merge identical adjacent tiles
5. WHEN tiles merge THEN the system SHALL combine their values and add the result to the player's score
6. WHEN no tiles can move in the pressed direction THEN the system SHALL not change the board state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want new tiles to appear after each move, so that the game continues with fresh challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player makes a valid move THEN the system SHALL add one new tile to a random empty position
2. WHEN a new tile is added THEN the system SHALL place either a 2 (90% probability) or 4 (10% probability)
3. WHEN there are no empty positions THEN the system SHALL not add a new tile

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my current score and best score, so that I can track my progress and achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tiles merge THEN the system SHALL add the merged tile value to the current score
2. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display the current score as 0
3. WHEN the current score exceeds the stored best score THEN the system SHALL update the best score
4. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display the previously saved best score
5. WHEN the best score is updated THEN the system SHALL persist it to local storage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to end when no more moves are possible, so that I know when the game is over.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the board is full AND no adjacent tiles have matching values THEN the system SHALL end the game
2. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL display a "Game Over" message
3. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL show the final score achieved
4. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL provide a restart option

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to restart the game at any time, so that I can start fresh without refreshing the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player clicks the restart button THEN the system SHALL reset the board to initial state
2. WHEN the game restarts THEN the system SHALL reset the current score to 0
3. WHEN the game restarts THEN the system SHALL place two initial tiles randomly on the board
4. WHEN the game restarts THEN the system SHALL preserve the best score

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want visual feedback for tile movements and merges, so that I can clearly see the game state changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tiles move THEN the system SHALL animate the movement smoothly
2. WHEN tiles have different values THEN the system SHALL display them with distinct colors and styling
3. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL update the visual display immediately
4. WHEN tiles merge THEN the system SHALL show the resulting tile in the correct position

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the game to work on different screen sizes, so that I can play on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL adjust tile sizes for smaller screens
2. WHEN the screen width is below 520px THEN the system SHALL use responsive tile dimensions
3. WHEN on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain game functionality and readability
4. WHEN the viewport changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout accordingly
